<---Marie's FAILED Plant Diary Capstone Project--->

**** Overview ****
My intent was to create a MERN stack app for managing plant data that I will eventually intergrate into my first project `plantCENTRIC`. Users would be able to  view and add plants along with information like watering & fertilizing.

**** Features ****
- View a list of plants
- Add a new plant
- Add watering and fertilzing information

**** Installation of the plantCENTRIC Plant Diary app ****
1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the `backend` folder, then run `npm install`.
3. After that go to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in both `backend` and `frontend` .

**** Running the Project ****
1. Start the backend server: `node server.js` in the `backend` folder.
2. Start the frontend application: `npm start` in the `frontend` folder.
3. Make `.env` folder 

**** What I Learned ****
- That coding like this is not for me. This has been an extremely stressful project for a beginner like myself. 
- That it's easy to break your code and get in a loop you cant seem to get out of. 

**** Future Enhancements ****
- Down the road once I can get this code to work I will implement user authentication and authorization. 
- I want to add more fields to the plant model.
- I want to establish additional styling and animations to make the entire site more interesting and seemless with my first projects design.
